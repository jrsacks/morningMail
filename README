Morning Mail

Weather, Sports, and Maybe More in a well formatted email to start your day

Installation:
Postfix and mailutils
  apt-get install postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules

  Configure postfix however you want.... sendmail works just fine for me: http://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/Mail_Servers/postfix.html
  Also added generic mapping to change sender address: http://www.postfix.org/generic.5.html

Set the timezone on a ubuntu server:
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata 

Ruby and Gems
  apt-get install ruby1.9.3
  apt-get install build-essential
  gem install nokogiri

Get key for weather underground and put in wunderground.key file

Schedule with cron to send at desired time:
./morningMail.rb | mail -s [subject] [to@email.address]
